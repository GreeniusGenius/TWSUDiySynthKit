# About

- This product is borne out of an original synthesiser kit built by the now bankrupt [Tech Will Save Us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_Will_Save_Us) company.
- The solderless breadboard nature of it frustrated me, and the lack of room to add a microcontroller for MIDI functionality on the breadboard made it unusable for how I would wish to use it.
- Then I got bored whilst designing it, and decided I'd turn it into a Pi Pico (2(W)) dev board too.
- It supports a Raspberry Pi standard hat.
- It supports a Raspberry Pi Pico bonnet.
- It supports Adafruit Stemma QT and Stemma connectors.
- It lets me try out the usage of jumpers to bypass voltage dividers reducing potential PCB revisions required.
